# Replication of 'Physiological Arousal and Political Beliefs'

This is a replication of the article "Physiological Arousal and Political Beliefs" (@renshon_lee_tingley_2014) using code and data available through the public Harvard Dataverse (@DVN/24318_2014). Below are replications of Figure 2, Table 1, and Figure 3. Several alterations are made to the replicated figures. Figure 2 is first presented in its original form then in a boxplot transformation in order to convey more distributional information. Two additional models, which include subject fixed effects, were added to table 1 to examine robustness. Finally, Figure 3's results were replicated using Bayesian distributions rather than frequentist. Formatting was improved for all three.

As an extension of the article's work, several interaction models, building upon the authors' work by integrating racial-group-specific treatment effects, are explored. These models suggest potentially interesting racial differences in treatment effects, but the power of these results are limited by a scarcity of observations.
